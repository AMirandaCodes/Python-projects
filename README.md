# Python Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **independent Python projects**.
It showcases practical applications of Python across different contexts â€” including personal tools, automation scripts, and Python projects applied professionally.  

Unlike my academic repositories (which contain course exercises and structured learning projects), this one focuses on self-initiated or professionally applied code, reflecting real problem-solving and implementation.


## Tech Stack & Tools

These projects make use of various technologies and libraries, including:

- **Python 3**
- **Playwright**, **BeautifulSoup4**, and **Selenium** for automation and web scraping
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Requests** and **APIs** for data retrieval
- **dotenv** and **argparse** for configuration and CLI tools

Each project includes its own `README.md` detailing setup, usage, and purpose.
